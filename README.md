* https://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.7/dojo/index.html#dojo-index (I'm using mostly pre-1.7 dojo functionality)

### Roadmap ###

* UI
    * Log
        * Log filters settings should be carried over the saved game
        * Log options should not be visible by default at least one of the related event occures
    * Resources
        * Edit icon for craft table to show/hide individual craft recipes

* QOL/Other
    * Ziggurat upgrades should be hidden by default and unlocked one by one

* Features
    TBD

* Portability
    * Render/Update loops should be decoupled from the Game class.
    * Most of the logic in the button handlers should be moved to the corresponding manager methods

Please feel free to add other suggestions.
